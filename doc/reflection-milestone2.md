## Reflection

### What we have implemented:

Our WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) [Dashboard](https://covid-19-mds-532-group3.herokuapp.com/) at this stage, has stayed loyal to what was suggested in our proposal and initial design from [milestone 1](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci532-group3/releases/tag/0.1.0). We have considered feedback from TA and implemented accordingly in the current version of the application. In this vein, the existing dashboard has only one tab (referred to as Time Period tab in milestone 1) as described in the following lines. The second tab (referred to as Region tab in milestone1) is schedules to be developed in future stages of this design project.

The left hand side of the dashboard is where all the necessary options for user exploration exist. There is the Selection Mode where allows user to choose the location of interest, which can be Country, Continent or the whole World using radio buttons. An interesting feature of this option is that user has the ability to choose multiple locations. Once a region is selected, the pertinent geographic location is highlighted on the left hand side map. The map has a zoom functionality with which the user can find the exact location of interest and even hover over to see the Country Code and Total number of Confirmed cases in that country . The user can also select a desired Time Range or even choose to view the data in Absolute or Per Capita format.

The output data are represented in from of interactive line charts for total numbers of Confirmed, Deaths and Recovered cases per time and are placed at the bottom side of the dashboard page, where the user can graphically track the trends of the COVID statistics.

### Future improvements and additions:

We are and will be constantly striving to improve our application and aim to implement certain features/improvements for the coming milestones of the project. Some of which are: 

-	Adding a Region tab to the dashboard which provides a more detailed look at region specific data and gives the user the ability to compare the data for two target countries. This feature is most suitable for policy-making decisions where one would like to make comparisons between developed countries and under-developed or developing countries.

-	Adding a clickability option to the map. This feature help user with selecting the country of interest and bypass browsing a long list of countries.
