## App Sketch

The purpose of this app is to allow users to explore global COVID-19 data by time and region in an intuitive manner.

The landing page consists of a world heatmap which highlights regions that have been most and least impacted by the virus. Users can select the continent, country and date range they are interested in by using the respective dropdown menus and sliders. There is also a further option to specify if they are interested in absolute or per capita data through the radio buttons below. Once these fields are filled out, the bottom of the page will populate several plots with aggregated data that the user can explore in greater detail. The scroll bar will allow them to view up to six plots.

The top menu has a "Region" button which leads the user into a region comparison page. The main functionality of this page is to provide a more detailed look at region specific data once the user understands the global landscape. They can again, select a time period, but also two specific countries on the map. The two countries selected will be highlighted and some general raw data will be displayed for each country. Aggregated comparison data will be displayed along the bottom to give the user a more comprehensive understanding of the similarities and differences between the two regions.

The intent of this app is for users to be able to explore both global trends as well as region by region comparisons in an iterative manner.
