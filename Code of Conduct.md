## Introduction

For DSCI 532 project, which is focused on “Designing a Dashboard for Interactive Data Visualization” we, members of group 3, are committed to forming a friendly and effective team environment where members are expected to learn, practice and accomplish project tasks while showing respect and courtesy to others. Aside from striving to fulfill academic goals, we hereby list a set of guidelines as ground rules that gravitate us towards working as an ethical, respectful and coherent team.

## Fundamental Guidelines

•	This group is project-focused, therefore anyone's work should be evaluated solely based on its merit, rather than on one's background.

•	As tasks are equally and fairly distributed, every teammate has the right to express their opinions and suggestions.

•	Teammates must be respectful and honest with each other, while being prompt and direct to ensure proper communication.

•	There is absolutely no room for plagiarism in this group.

•	Everyone who participates in DSCI 532 project activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct. It applies to all spaces within which these activities are accomplished including but not limited to meetings and communications.

## Standards

Every member of our group has the right to have their identity respected. This group is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

### Examples of encouraged behaviors include:

•	Focusing on what is best for the group as a whole

•	Being respectful and kind to teammates

•	Thinking from teammates' perspective and provoke mutual understanding

•	Being humble and open-minded when accepting criticism from teammates

•	Assisting others when they have troubles in a specific task

•	Showing empathy towards other community members

### Examples of unacceptable behaviors include:

•	The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances

•	Verbally insulting teammates under any circumstances

•	Public or private harassment

•	Judging others because their work is deemed unsatisfying

•	Revealing unauthorized private information of others, such as their phone number, home address, without explicit permission

•	Skipping allocated responsibilities and causing a burden on the rest of the teammates

•	Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Members who violate this Code of Conduct will be asked to stop the behavior and are expected to comply immediately. If the member(s) continues to engage in activities violating this code, the teaching staff will be notified to impose corresponding consequences according to the school policy.

### Reporting guideline

If you witness someone violating this Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to the DSCI 532 Instructor(s). The course instructor is Joel Ostblom. An email to joel.ostblom@ubc.ca  will be seen by Joel Ostblom. Alternatively, you may also contact Analise Hofmann, a current Teaching Assistant of this course.
