## App Sketch

The purpose of this app is to allow users to explore global Covid-19 data by time and region in an intuitive manner.

The landing page consists of a world heatmap which highlights regions that have been most and least impacted by the virus. Users can toggle through the navigation bar along the bottom to select a specific month or a range of months to update the heatmap. The right side of the page will include some plots of aggregated data, filter by the specified time period, which the user can explore in more detail.

The toggle collapse menu at the top left then leads the user into a region comparison page. The main functionality of this page is to provide a more detailed look at region specific data once the user understands the global landscape. They can again, select a time period, but also two specific countries on the map. The two countries selected will be highlighted and some general raw data will be displayed for each country. Aggregated comparison data will be displayed on the right side to give the user a more comprehensive understanding of the similarities and differences between the two regions.

The intent of this app is for users to be able to explore both global trends as well as region by region comparisons in an iterative manner.
